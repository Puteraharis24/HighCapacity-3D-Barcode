A loop iterates Max_frames times to generate each frame of the barcode.Within each frame, another loop generates each bit of the barcode. The bits are retrieved from BinaryInput based on the current frame index and bit position. Depending on the bit value, either black or white matrices are chosen to represent the bit. The bits are placed in a 10x10 block within a larger Barcode matrix. The Barcode matrix is then duplicated and concatenated to form a larger barcode matrix. The barcode is padded with white space and a border. Error bits and frame information are added to the header of the barcode.
The header bits are similarly generated and placed in a separate Hdr_barcode matrix.
The Hdr_barcode is padded, and the barcode and header are concatenated to form the final barcode frame.
The frame is stored in the ThreeDBarcode array as a frame for video In recent years, the usage of barcodes for example QR codes has been at its peak role in people’s daily activities. COVID-19 worldwide pandemic has helped boost the usage of the QR code massively in almost everything. Such as payment, advertisement techniques, identification, and tracking device which trace the user’s movement to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 disease. It is not strange at all that more people are becoming familiar with QR codes because it is one of the easiest tools that connect the virtual world to real life.
